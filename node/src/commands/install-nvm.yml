    Install custom versions of Node.js, and optionally NPM/Yarn, in any
    execution environment (Docker/Linux, macOS, machine) that does not have
    it preinstalled.

    Recommendation: It is highly recommended to utilize an environment such as Docker with Node preinstalled.

steps:
    - run:
          name: Install NVM
          command: <<include(scripts/install-nvm.sh)>>
